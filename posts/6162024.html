 <p>This morning, I had a good run outside in the park. 
    It felt very relaxing and I enjoyed it very much. It lasted
for around 6 minutes which is how long I usually run for when doing
1 lap around the neighborhood. This run was a bit different 
because I helped pick up the cucumbers my mom bought on the way
back. Overall, I continue to enjoy running and hope that I 
will keep on doing it this summer break.</p>
